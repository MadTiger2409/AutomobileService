# AutomobileService
AutomobileService is a ASP.NET Core MVC webservice about cars and car modding.


## Idea
* The idea is to create a interesting webservice where you can share, comment and rate car projects. You can also compare one project to another (or to a mass-produced version) via special comparison tool.
* You can also pesonalize your profile by adding avatar, yout dream car, your current car, name, surname, place of residence.


## Technologies
TDD, DDD and a bunch of technologies, like: Angular4, Entity Framework Core, TypeScript, SASS etc.
